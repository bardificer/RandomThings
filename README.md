This exists because Amazon removed `Amazon Assistant` so I can't link to external sources on amazon anymore, which is very very annoying.

# Birthday Things
Some of the things that I want I either can't have now, or are literally not out now, so they'll be detailed here if you want to give me money towards something.

### Lite3DP Gen 2
This is a very very cool tiny 3d printer. It uses a different technique than the printer I have, so it will let me make very small (but very detailed) 3d prints. The 1st generation wasn't very expensive, so I'm hoping this one isn't either.

### Another Bird
Okay so I have Ruby, and he's a wonderful little bird. He's really anxious though, so a potential in the near future (depends on job outlook and life circumnstances) is to get another bird to keep him company. This will do a few things:
- Make his birdy social life better, so he'll be happier
- Make it better for him when he has to travel anywhere, to have another friend with him.
- Keep him company when I'm at work or otherwise out of the house for long periods at a time.

*If* I get another bird, it would be a black-capped conure. I know a local breeder who treats their birds very well, so everything would be good and humane. You can give me money towards another bird and if I end up not getting another, the money will go to my ongoing education (or living expenses) which I'm sure you'd like me to do anyway.
