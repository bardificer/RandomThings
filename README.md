This exists because Amazon removed `Amazon Assistant` so I can't link to external sources on amazon anymore, which is very very annoying.

# Birthday Things
Some of the things that I want I either can't have now, or are literally not out now, so they'll be detailed here if you want to give me money towards something.

### Lite3DP Gen 2
This is a very very cool tiny 3d printer. It uses a different technique than the printer I have, so it will let me make very small (but very detailed) 3d prints. The 1st generation wasn't very expensive, so I'm hoping this one isn't either.

### Another Bird
Okay so I have Ruby, and he's a wonderful little bird. He's really anxious though, so a potential in the near future (depends on job outlook and life circumnstances) is to get another bird to keep him company. This will do a few things:
- Make his birdy social life better, so he'll be happier
- Make it better for him when he has to travel anywhere, to have another friend with him.
- Keep him company when I'm at work or otherwise out of the house for long periods at a time.

*If* I get another bird, it would be a black-capped conure. I know a local breeder who treats their birds very well, so everything would be good and humane. You can give me money towards another bird and if I end up not getting another, the money will go to my ongoing education (or living expenses) which I'm sure you'd like me to do anyway.

### Bash Bunny
This is a really really cool tool. It's a computer inside a USB. It can be used in a bunch of different ways, with automated scripts for both defensive and offensive cybersecurity actions.

### Notebook Morale Organizer
It's really just a computer bag, but it's got lots of storage space for both it's designated hacking tools and other stuff. The ability to put patches on the front of it is also awesome. Quick tip, if you buy it with any of the tools in the "field kit" there's a discount. Really only applies if you also want to get the Bash Bunny
